## DESCRIPTION
This website was created to feature adoptable cats using PetFinder.com's API. To make adopting cats more appealing than simply going to a pet store, we've given these furry friends a bit of personality. When a user selects a fluffy friend, the webapp displays a joke from the Joke API and a link to their PetFinder page so users can decide whether to adopt them.

## CHALLENGES
This webapp was conceived to fulfill requirements for our team's first coding bootcamp project, chief among them the usage of 2 APIs that were to work together and react to user input.
Our team was forced to pivot early on due to API availability (or lack thereof). We learned that on a short (2-week) timeline, it would be essential to choose APIs that would not require extensive wait times for key approval, but also featured robust enough hosting to handle our requests.
