<STRONG> DESCRIPTION </strong>

* V1: This website was created to feature adoptable cats in the Chicagoland area. To make adopting cats more appealing than simply going to a pet store, we've given these furry friends a bit of personality. When a user selects a fluffy friend, it directs them to a link to adopt the cat and a piece of advice for their potiential new parent!
